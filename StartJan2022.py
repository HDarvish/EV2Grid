# Here we are going to remodel the paper by Boston et al. 2021

# in the section 2.5 we can find the flowchart and also the main code behind 
# such a system!

# this is a paragraph form the method of this paper:
    
    
    # The hourly generated PV power is taken as input to the model,
    # see Section 2.4. The energy load, besides road going transport,
    # of Spain is discussed and calculated in Section 2.1.
    # The hourly energy load, besides road going transport,
    # is calculated and used as input to the simulation model 
    # according to the profiles shown in Section 2.3. Lastly, 
    # the hourly energy load of the road going transport is calculated 
    # according to Section 2.2 and subsequently given as an input to 
    # the simulation model. The simulation models calculates 
    # the state of the charge (SOC) for the aggregated EV fleet with 
    # an hourly temporal resolution. Movingvehiclesand stationary vehicles
    # are treated separately in the calculation.
